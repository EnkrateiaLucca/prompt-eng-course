Conventional reference-\\nbased metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE,\\nhave been shown to have relatively low cor-\\nrelation with human judgments, especially for\\ntasks that require creativity and diversity. Re-\\ncent studies suggest using large language mod-\\nels (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG\\nevaluation, which have the benefit of being ap-\\nplicable to new tasks that lack human refer-\\nences. However, these LLM-based evaluators\\nstill have lower human correspondence than\\nmedium-size neural evaluators. In this work,\\nwe present G-E VAL, a framework of using\\nlarge language models with chain-of-thoughts\\n(CoT) and a form-filling paradigm, to assess the\\nquality of NLG outputs. We experiment with\\ntwo generation tasks, text summarization and\\ndialogue generation. We show that G-E VAL\\nwith GPT-4 as the backbone model achieves a\\nSpearman correlation of 0.514with human on\\nsummarization task, outperforming all previous\\nmethods by a large margin. We also propose\\nanalysis on the behavior of LLM-based eval-\\nuators, and highlight the potential concern of\\nLLM-based evaluators having a bias towards\\nthe LLM-generated texts.1\\n1 Introduction\\nEvaluating the quality of natural language genera-\\ntion systems is a challenging problem even when\\nlarge language models can generate high-quality\\nand diverse texts that are often indistinguishable\\nfrom human-written texts (Ouyang et al., 2022).\\nTraditional automatic metrics, such as BLEU (Pap-\\nineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and ME-\\nTEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), are widely used\\nfor NLG evaluation, but they have been shown to\\nhave relatively low correlation with human judg-\\nments, especially for open-ended generation tasks.\\n1https://github.com/nlpyang/gevalMoreover, these metrics require associated refer-\\nence output, which is costly to collect for new tasks.\\nRecent studies propose directly using LLMs as\\nreference-free NLG evaluators (Fu et al., 2023;\\nWang et al., 2023a). The idea is to use the LLMs to\\nscore the candidate output based on its generation\\nprobability without any reference target, under the\\nassumption that the LLMs have learned to assign\\nhigher probabilities to high-quality and fluent texts.\\nMeanwhile, it is becoming popular to use more\\npowerful LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate smaller or\\nstudent models, like in Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023)\\nand Vicuna (Zheng et al., 2023). However, the\\nvalidity and reliability of using LLMs as NLG eval-\\nuators have not been systematically investigated.\\nIn addition, meta-evaluations show that these LLM-\\nbased evaluators still have lower human correspon-\\ndence than medium-size neural evaluators (Zhong\\net al., 2022). Thus, there is a need for a more ef-\\nfective and reliable framework for using LLMs for\\nNLG evaluation.\\nIn this paper, we propose G-E VAL, a framework\\nof using LLMs with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) (Wei\\net al., 2022) to evaluate the quality of generated\\ntexts in a form-filling paradigm. By only feeding\\nthe Task Introduction and the Evaluation Criteria\\nas a prompt, we ask LLMs to generate a CoT of\\ndetailed Evaluation Steps. Then we use the prompt\\nalong with the generated CoT to evaluate the NLG\\noutputs. The evaluator output is formatted as a\\nform. Moreover, the probabilities of the output\\nrating tokens can be used to refine the final met-\\nric. We conduct extensive experiments on three\\nmeta-evaluation benchmarks of two NLG tasks:\\ntext summarization and dialogue generation. The\\nresults show that G-E VAL can outperform existing\\nNLG evaluators by a large margin in terms of corre-\\nlation with human evaluations. Finally, we conduct\\nanalysis on the behavior of LLM-based evaluators,\\nand highlight the potential issue of LLM-based\\nevaluator having a bias towards the LLM-generated2511 texts.\\nTo summarize, our main contributions and find-\\nings in this paper are:\\n1.G-E VAL generally outperforms reference-\\nbased and reference-free baseline metrics in\\nterms of correlation with human quality judg-\\nments, especially for open-ended and creative\\nNLG tasks, such as dialogue response genera-\\ntion.\\n2.We propose to use automatic chain-of-thought\\nto improve the performance of LLM-based\\nevaluators by providing more context and\\nguidance.\\n3.We propose to re-weight the discrete scores by\\ntheir respective token probabilities to provide\\na more fine-grained continuous score for G-\\nEVAL.\\n4.We conduct an analysis of the potential is-\\nsue that LLM-based metrics have a prefer-\\nence of LLM-generated texts over human-\\nwritten texts, which may lead to the self-\\nreinforcement of LLMs if LLM-based metrics\\nare used as the reward signal for improving\\nthemselves.\\n2 Method\\nG-E VAL is a prompt-based evaluator with three\\nmain components: 1) a prompt that contains the def-\\ninition of the evaluation task and the desired evalu-\\nation criteria, 2) a chain-of-thoughts (CoT) that is\\na set of intermediate instructions generated by the\\nLLM describing the detailed evaluation steps, and\\n3) a scoring function that calls LLM and calculates\\nthe score based on the probabilities of the return\\ntokens.\\nPrompt for NLG Evaluation The prompt is a\\nnatural language instruction that defines the evalu-\\nation task and the desired evaluation criteria. For\\nexample, for text summarization, the prompt can\\nbe:\\nYou will be given one summary written\\nfor a news article. Your task is to rate\\nthe summary on one metric.\\nPlease make sure you read and under-\\nstand these instructions carefully. Please\\nkeep this document open while reviewing,\\nand refer to it as needed.The prompt should also contain customized eval-\\nuation criteria for different NLG tasks and, such as\\ncoherence, conciseness, or grammar. For example,\\nfor evaluating coherence in text summarization, we\\nadd the following content to the prompt:\\nEvaluation Criteria:\\nCoherence (1-5) - the collective quality\\nof all sentences. We align this dimen-\\nsion with the DUC quality question of\\nstructure and coherence whereby \"the\\nsummary should be well-structured and\\nwell-organized. The summary should not\\njust be a heap of related information, but\\nshould build from sentence to sentence\\nto a coherent body of information about\\na topic.\"\\nAuto Chain-of-Thoughts for NLG Evaluation\\nThe chain-of-thoughts (CoT) is a sequence of in-\\ntermediate representations that are generated by\\nthe LLM during the text generation process. For\\nevaluation tasks, some criteria need a more detailed\\nevaluation instruction beyond the simple definition,\\nand it is time-consuming to manually design such\\nevaluation steps for each task. We find that LLM\\ncan generate such evaluation steps by itself. The\\nCoT can provide more context and guidance for the\\nLLM to evaluate the generated text, and can also\\nhelp to explain the evaluation process and results.\\nFor example, for evaluating coherence in text sum-\\nmarization, we add a line of “Evaluation Steps:\" to\\nthe prompt and let LLM to generate the following\\nCoT automatically:\\n1. Read the news article carefully and\\nidentify the main topic and key points.\\n2. Read the summary and compare it to\\nthe news article. Check if the summary\\ncovers the main topic and key points of\\nthe news article, and if it presents them\\nin a clear and logical order.\\n3. Assign a score for coherence on a\\nscale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and\\n5 is the highest based on the Evaluation\\nCriteria.\\nScoring Function The scoring function calls the\\nLLM with the designed prompt, auto CoT, the input\\ncontext and the target text that needs to be evalu-\\nated. Unlike GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) which uses2512 Auto\\nCoTTask Introduction\\nYou will be given one summary written for a news \\narticle.

We first input Task Introduction and Evaluation Criteria to the LLM,\\nand ask it to generate a CoT of detailed Evaluation Steps. Then we use the prompt along with the generated CoT to\\nevaluate the NLG outputs in a form-filling paradigm. Finally, we use the probability-weighted summation of the\\noutput scores as the final score.\\nthe conditional probability of generating the tar-\\nget text as an evaluation metric, G-E VAL directly\\nperforms the evaluation task with a form-filling\\nparadigm. This provides a more flexible way to\\nevaluate the text as the model can behave directly\\nbased on the evaluation criteria and steps. For ex-\\nample, for evaluating coherence in text summariza-\\ntion, we concatenate the prompt, the CoT, the news\\narticle, and the summary, and then call the LLM\\nto output a score from 1 to 5 for each evaluation\\naspect, based on the defined criteria.\\nHowever, we notice this direct scoring function\\nhas two issues:\\n1.For some evaluation tasks, one digit usually\\ndominates the distribution of the scores, such\\nas 3 for a 1 - 5 scale. This may lead to the low\\nvariance of the scores and the low correlation\\nwith human judgments.\\n2.LLMs usually only output integer scores, even\\nwhen the prompt explicitly requests decimal\\nvalues. This leads to many ties in evaluation\\nscores which do not capture the subtle differ-\\nence between generated texts.\\nTo address these issues, we propose using theprobabilities of output tokens from LLMs to nor-\\nmalize the scores and take their weighted summa-\\ntion as the final results. Formally, given a set of\\nscores (like from 1 to 5) predefined in the prompt\\nS={s1, s2, ..., s n}, the probability of each score\\np(si)is calculated by the LLM, and the final score\\nis:\\nscore =n∑\\ni=1p(si)×si (1)\\nThis method obtains more fine-grained, continu-\\nous scores that better reflect the quality and diver-\\nsity of the generated texts.\\n3 Experiments\\nFollowing Zhong et al.

One\\nconcern about using LLM as an evaluator is that it\\nmay prefer the outputs generated by the LLM itself,\\nrather than the high-quality human-written texts.\\nTo investigate this issue, we conduct an experi-\\nment on the summarization task, where we com-\\npare the evaluation scores of the LLM-generated\\nand the human-written summaries. We use the\\ndataset collected in Zhang et al. (2023), where they\\nfirst ask freelance writers to write high-quality sum-\\nmaries for news articles, and then ask annotators\\nto compare human-written summaries and LLM-\\n3.753.83.853.93.954\\nHuman\\nSummaryGPT-3.5\\nSummaryHuman\\nSummaryGPT-3.5\\nSummaryHuman\\nSummaryGPT-3.5\\nSummary\\nHuman Summary is Better LLM Summary is Better Equally GoodFigure 2: Averaged G-E VAL-4’s scores for human-\\nwritten summaries and GPT-3.5 summaries, divided\\nby human judges’ preference.\\ngenerated summaries (using GPT-3.5, text-davinci-\\n003).\\nThe dataset can be divided in three categories:\\n1) human-written summaries that are rated higher\\nthan GPT-3.5 summaries by human judges, 2)\\nhuman-written summaries that are rated lower\\nthan GPT-3.5 summaries by human judges, and 3)\\nhuman-written summaries and GPT-3.5 summaries\\nare rated equally good by human judges.

We can see\\nthat, G-E VAL-4 assigns higher scores to human-\\nwritten summaries when human judges also pre-\\nfer human-written summaries, and assigns lower\\nscores when human judges prefer GPT-3.5 sum-\\nmaries. However, G-E VAL-4 always gives higher\\nscores to GPT-3.5 summaries than human-written\\n2We use G-E VAL-4 in this experiment, because its su-\\nperiority in evaluating summarization tasks. Although it has\\ndifferent distribution with with GPT-3.5, the two LLMs should\\nshare similar behaviors in terms of text generation.2516 summaries, even when human judges prefer human-\\nwritten summaries. We propose two potential rea-\\nsons for this phenomenon:\\n1.NLG outputs from high-quality systems are\\nin natural difficult to evaluate. The authors of\\nthe original paper found that inter-annotator\\nagreement on judging human-written and\\nLLM-generated summaries is very low, with\\nKrippendorff’s alpha at 0.07.\\n2.G-E VAL may have a bias towards the LLM-\\ngenerated summaries because the model could\\nshare the same concept of evaluation criteria\\nduring generation and evaluation.\\nOur work should be considered as a preliminary\\nstudy on this issue, and more research is needed\\nto fully understand the behavior of LLM-based\\nevaluators to reduce its inherent bias towards LLM-\\ngenerated text. We highlight this concern in the\\ncontext that LLM-based evaluators may lead to\\nself-reinforcement of LLMs if the evaluation score\\nis used as a reward signal for further tuning. And\\nthis could result in the over-fitting of the LLMs to\\ntheir own evaluation criteria, rather than the true\\nevaluation criteria of the NLG tasks.\\nThe Effect of Chain-of-Thoughts We compare\\nthe performance of G-E VAL with and without\\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) on the SummEval bench-\\nmark. Table 1 shows that G-E VAL-4 with CoT has\\nhigher correlation than G-E VAL-4 without CoT\\non all dimensions, especially for fluency . This\\nsuggests that CoT can provide more context and\\nguidance for the LLM to evaluate the generated\\ntext, and can also help to explain the evaluation\\nprocess and results. And it is shown that CoT is\\nmore useful on consistency andfluency dimen-\\nsions. We also provide results of G-E VAL with\\na simple prompting baseline on SummEval (only\\nasking GPT-4 to score a summary from 1-5 on\\neach dimension, without detailed task introduction,\\nevaluation criteria and CoT).\\nThe Effect of Probability Normalization We\\ncompare the performance of G-E VAL with and\\nwithout probability normalization on the Sum-\\nmEval benchmark. Table 1 shows that, on Kendall-\\nTau correlation, G-E VAL-4 with probabilities is\\ninferior to G-E VAL-4 without probabilities on Sum-\\nmEval. We believe this is related to the calculation\\nof Kendall-Tau correlation, which is based on the\\nnumber of concordant and discordant pairs. Directscoring without probabilities can lead to many ties,\\nwhich are not counted as either concordant or dis-\\ncordant. This may result in a higher Kendall-Tau\\ncorrelation, but it does not reflect the model’s true\\ncapacity of evaluating the generated texts. On the\\nother hand, probability normalization can obtain\\nmore fine-grained, continuous scores that better\\ncapture the subtle difference between generated\\ntexts. This is reflected by the higher Spearman cor-\\nrelation of G-E VAL-4 with probabilities, which is\\nbased on the rank order of the scores.\\nThe Effect of Different LLMs We compare\\nthe performance of G-E VAL with different LLMs\\non the SummEval and QAGS benchmarks. Ta-\\nble 1 and Table 3 show that G-E VAL-4 has\\nhigher correlation than G-E VAL-3.5 on most di-\\nmensions and datasets, except for engagingness\\nand groundedness on the Topical-Chat bench-\\nmark. This demonstrates that a better LLM can\\nimprove the performance of G-E VAL, especially\\nfor more challenging and complex evaluation tasks,\\nsuch as consistency andrelevance .\\n5 Related Work\\nNgram-based Metrics Ngram-based metrics re-\\nfer to the scores for evaluating the NLG models by\\nmeasuring the lexical overlap between a generated\\ntext and a reference text. BLEU (Papineni et al.,\\n2002) is the most widely used metric for machine\\ntranslation evaluation, which calculates the geomet-\\nric mean of modified n-gram precision and a brevity\\npenalty. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a recall-oriented\\nmetric for summarization evaluation, which mea-\\nsures the n-gram overlap between a generated sum-\\nmary and a set of reference summaries. It has been\\nshown that more than 60% of recent papers on\\nNLG only rely on ROUGE or BLEU to evaluate\\ntheir systems (Kasai et al., 2022). However, these\\nmetrics fail to measure content quality (Reiter and\\nBelz, 2009) or capture syntactic errors (Stent et al.,\\n2005), and therefore do not reflect the reliability of\\nNLG systems accurately.\\nEmbedding-based Metrics Embedding-based\\nmetrics refer to the scores for evaluating the NLG\\nmodels by measuring the semantic similarity be-\\ntween a generated text and a reference text based\\non the word or sentence embeddings. WMD (Kus-\\nner et al., 2015) is a metric that measures the dis-\\ntance between two texts based on the word embed-\\ndings. BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) measures2517 the similarity between two texts based on the con-\\ntextualized embedding from BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2019). MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) improves\\nBERTScore by adding soft alignments and new\\naggregation methods to obtain a more robust simi-\\nlarity measure. (Clark et al., 2019) propose a metric\\nthat evaluates multi-sentence texts by computing\\nthe similarity between the generated text and the\\nreference text based on the sentence embeddings.\\nTask-specific Evaluators Task-specific metrics\\nrefer to the scores for evaluating the NLG mod-\\nels by measuring the quality of the generated texts\\nbased on the specific task requirements. For ex-\\nample, summarization tasks need to assess the\\nconsistency of the generated summaries (Kry ´s-\\nci´nski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Cao et al.,\\n2020; Durmus et al., 2020), and dialogue response\\ngeneration tasks need to assess the coherence of\\nthe generated responses (Dziri et al., 2019; Ye et al.,\\n2021; Ghazarian et al., 2019). However, these met-\\nrics are not generalizable to other NLG tasks, and\\nthey are not able to measure the overall quality of\\nthe generated texts.\\nUnified Evaluators Recently, some evaluators\\nhave been developed to assess text quality from\\nmultiple dimensions by varying the input and out-\\nput contents (Yuan et al., 2021) or the model vari-\\nants (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020) they use. UniEval\\n(Zhong et al., 2022) is a unified evaluator that can\\nevaluate different aspects of text generation as QA\\ntasks. By changing the question format, it can han-\\ndle different evaluation tasks.\\nLLM-based Evaluators Fu et al. (2023) propose\\nGPTScore, a new framework that evaluated texts\\nwith generative pre-training models like GPT-3. It\\nassumes that a generative pre-training model will\\nassign a higher probability of high-quality gener-\\nated text following a given instruction and context.\\nWang et al. (2023a) conduct a preliminary survey\\nof using ChatGPT as a NLG evaluator. Kocmi and\\nFedermann (2023); Lu et al. (2023) proposed to\\nuse GPT models for evaluating machine translation\\ntasks. Very recently, Wang et al. (2023b) investi-\\ngated the problem of unfairness when using large\\nmodels in evaluating dialogue responses.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we propose G-E VAL, a framework of\\nusing LLM with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) to eval-\\nuate the quality of generated texts. We conductextensive experiments on two NLG tasks, text sum-\\nmarization and dialogue generation, and show that\\nG-E VAL can outperform state-of-the-art evaluators\\nand achieve higher human correspondence. We\\nalso propose preliminary analysis on the behavior\\nof LLM-based evaluators, and highlight the poten-\\ntial issue of LLM-based evaluator having a bias\\ntowards the LLM-generated texts. We hope our\\nwork can inspire more research on using LLMs for\\nNLG evaluation, and also raise awareness of the\\npotential risks and challenges of using LLMs as\\nevaluators.\\nLimitations\\nG-E VALis a framework that uses LLMs to evaluate\\nthe quality of generated texts. However, it also has\\nsome limitations that need to be addressed in future\\nwork.\\n1.As we already discussed in the paper, G-E VAL\\nmay have a bias towards the LLM-generated\\ntexts. This may lead to the self-reinforcement\\nof LLMs if the evaluation score is used as\\na reward signal for further tuning. And this\\ncould result in the over-fitting of the LLMs to\\ntheir own evaluation criteria, rather than the\\ntrue evaluation criteria of the NLG tasks.\\n2.G-E VAL is limited by the availability and ac-\\ncessibility of LLMs. Currently, most LLMs\\nare not publicly available, and require special\\naccess or payment to use. This may limit the\\napplicability and reproducibility of G-E VAL.\\nMoreover, the LLMs are constantly updated,\\nwhich may lead to inconsistent evaluation re-\\nsults across different versions of the LLMs.\\n3.We meta-evaluate G-E VALon two NLG tasks,\\ntext summarization and dialogue generation.\\nHowever, there are some emerging NLG tasks\\nin the LLM era where users prompt with free-\\nform natural language instructions. In this\\ncase, the evaluation criteria may need to be\\nmore flexible and adaptive to the user’s inten-\\ntion and preference. Therefore, more research\\nis needed to explore how to use G-E VAL for\\nevaluating these new types of NLG tasks.\\nEthics Statement\\nTheG-E VAL framework we proposed is designed\\nto offer a more effective and reliable method for\\nassessing natural language generation systems. Its2518 purpose is to aid researchers, developers, and other\\ninterested parties in evaluating the quality of text\\nproduced by NLG systems. Possible risks could\\nexist if G-E VAL is unable to precisely evaluate the\\nquality of produced texts or shows a preference for\\nLLM-created texts. This could lead to developers\\noverestimating the performance of their systems\\nor unintentionally reinforcing biases in their mod-\\nels. Furthermore, users depending on the generated\\nmaterial may receive low-quality or biased infor-\\nmation.\\nReferences\\nSatanjeev Banerjee and Alon Lavie. 2005.

Conventional reference-\\nbased metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE,\\nhave been shown to have relatively low cor-\\nrelation with human judgments, especially for\\ntasks that require creativity and diversity. Re-\\ncent studies suggest using large language mod-\\nels (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG\\nevaluation, which have the benefit of being ap-\\nplicable to new tasks that lack human refer-\\nences. However, these LLM-based evaluators\\nstill have lower human correspondence than\\nmedium-size neural evaluators. In this work,\\nwe present G-E VAL, a framework of using\\nlarge language models with chain-of-thoughts\\n(CoT) and a form-filling paradigm, to assess the\\nquality of NLG outputs. We experiment with\\ntwo generation tasks, text summarization and\\ndialogue generation. We show that G-E VAL\\nwith GPT-4 as the backbone model achieves a\\nSpearman correlation of 0.514with human on\\nsummarization task, outperforming all previous\\nmethods by a large margin. We also propose\\nanalysis on the behavior of LLM-based eval-\\nuators, and highlight the potential concern of\\nLLM-based evaluators having a bias towards\\nthe LLM-generated texts.1\\n1 Introduction\\nEvaluating the quality of natural language genera-\\ntion systems is a challenging problem even when\\nlarge language models can generate high-quality\\nand diverse texts that are often indistinguishable\\nfrom human-written texts (Ouyang et al., 2022).\\nTraditional automatic metrics, such as BLEU (Pap-\\nineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and ME-\\nTEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), are widely used\\nfor NLG evaluation, but they have been shown to\\nhave relatively low correlation with human judg-\\nments, especially for open-ended generation tasks.\\n1https://github.com/nlpyang/gevalMoreover, these metrics require associated refer-\\nence output, which is costly to collect for new tasks.\\nRecent studies propose directly using LLMs as\\nreference-free NLG evaluators (Fu et al., 2023;\\nWang et al., 2023a). The idea is to use the LLMs to\\nscore the candidate output based on its generation\\nprobability without any reference target, under the\\nassumption that the LLMs have learned to assign\\nhigher probabilities to high-quality and fluent texts.\\nMeanwhile, it is becoming popular to use more\\npowerful LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate smaller or\\nstudent models, like in Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023)\\nand Vicuna (Zheng et al., 2023). However, the\\nvalidity and reliability of using LLMs as NLG eval-\\nuators have not been systematically investigated.\\nIn addition, meta-evaluations show that these LLM-\\nbased evaluators still have lower human correspon-\\ndence than medium-size neural evaluators (Zhong\\net al., 2022). Thus, there is a need for a more ef-\\nfective and reliable framework for using LLMs for\\nNLG evaluation.\\nIn this paper, we propose G-E VAL, a framework\\nof using LLMs with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) (Wei\\net al., 2022) to evaluate the quality of generated\\ntexts in a form-filling paradigm. By only feeding\\nthe Task Introduction and the Evaluation Criteria\\nas a prompt, we ask LLMs to generate a CoT of\\ndetailed Evaluation Steps. Then we use the prompt\\nalong with the generated CoT to evaluate the NLG\\noutputs. The evaluator output is formatted as a\\nform. Moreover, the probabilities of the output\\nrating tokens can be used to refine the final met-\\nric. We conduct extensive experiments on three\\nmeta-evaluation benchmarks of two NLG tasks:\\ntext summarization and dialogue generation. The\\nresults show that G-E VAL can outperform existing\\nNLG evaluators by a large margin in terms of corre-\\nlation with human evaluations. Finally, we conduct\\nanalysis on the behavior of LLM-based evaluators,\\nand highlight the potential issue of LLM-based\\nevaluator having a bias towards the LLM-generated2511 texts.\\nTo summarize, our main contributions and find-\\nings in this paper are:\\n1.G-E VAL generally outperforms reference-\\nbased and reference-free baseline metrics in\\nterms of correlation with human quality judg-\\nments, especially for open-ended and creative\\nNLG tasks, such as dialogue response genera-\\ntion.\\n2.We propose to use automatic chain-of-thought\\nto improve the performance of LLM-based\\nevaluators by providing more context and\\nguidance.\\n3.We propose to re-weight the discrete scores by\\ntheir respective token probabilities to provide\\na more fine-grained continuous score for G-\\nEVAL.\\n4.We conduct an analysis of the potential is-\\nsue that LLM-based metrics have a prefer-\\nence of LLM-generated texts over human-\\nwritten texts, which may lead to the self-\\nreinforcement of LLMs if LLM-based metrics\\nare used as the reward signal for improving\\nthemselves.\\n2 Method\\nG-E VAL is a prompt-based evaluator with three\\nmain components: 1) a prompt that contains the def-\\ninition of the evaluation task and the desired evalu-\\nation criteria, 2) a chain-of-thoughts (CoT) that is\\na set of intermediate instructions generated by the\\nLLM describing the detailed evaluation steps, and\\n3) a scoring function that calls LLM and calculates\\nthe score based on the probabilities of the return\\ntokens.\\nPrompt for NLG Evaluation The prompt is a\\nnatural language instruction that defines the evalu-\\nation task and the desired evaluation criteria. For\\nexample, for text summarization, the prompt can\\nbe:\\nYou will be given one summary written\\nfor a news article. Your task is to rate\\nthe summary on one metric.\\nPlease make sure you read and under-\\nstand these instructions carefully. Please\\nkeep this document open while reviewing,\\nand refer to it as needed.The prompt should also contain customized eval-\\nuation criteria for different NLG tasks and, such as\\ncoherence, conciseness, or grammar. For example,\\nfor evaluating coherence in text summarization, we\\nadd the following content to the prompt:\\nEvaluation Criteria:\\nCoherence (1-5) - the collective quality\\nof all sentences. We align this dimen-\\nsion with the DUC quality question of\\nstructure and coherence whereby \"the\\nsummary should be well-structured and\\nwell-organized. The summary should not\\njust be a heap of related information, but\\nshould build from sentence to sentence\\nto a coherent body of information about\\na topic.\"\\nAuto Chain-of-Thoughts for NLG Evaluation\\nThe chain-of-thoughts (CoT) is a sequence of in-\\ntermediate representations that are generated by\\nthe LLM during the text generation process. For\\nevaluation tasks, some criteria need a more detailed\\nevaluation instruction beyond the simple definition,\\nand it is time-consuming to manually design such\\nevaluation steps for each task. We find that LLM\\ncan generate such evaluation steps by itself. The\\nCoT can provide more context and guidance for the\\nLLM to evaluate the generated text, and can also\\nhelp to explain the evaluation process and results.\\nFor example, for evaluating coherence in text sum-\\nmarization, we add a line of “Evaluation Steps:\" to\\nthe prompt and let LLM to generate the following\\nCoT automatically:\\n1. Read the news article carefully and\\nidentify the main topic and key points.\\n2. Read the summary and compare it to\\nthe news article. Check if the summary\\ncovers the main topic and key points of\\nthe news article, and if it presents them\\nin a clear and logical order.\\n3. Assign a score for coherence on a\\nscale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and\\n5 is the highest based on the Evaluation\\nCriteria.\\nScoring Function The scoring function calls the\\nLLM with the designed prompt, auto CoT, the input\\ncontext and the target text that needs to be evalu-\\nated.

We first input Task Introduction and Evaluation Criteria to the LLM,\\nand ask it to generate a CoT of detailed Evaluation Steps. Then we use the prompt along with the generated CoT to\\nevaluate the NLG outputs in a form-filling paradigm. Finally, we use the probability-weighted summation of the\\noutput scores as the final score.\\nthe conditional probability of generating the tar-\\nget text as an evaluation metric, G-E VAL directly\\nperforms the evaluation task with a form-filling\\nparadigm. This provides a more flexible way to\\nevaluate the text as the model can behave directly\\nbased on the evaluation criteria and steps. For ex-\\nample, for evaluating coherence in text summariza-\\ntion, we concatenate the prompt, the CoT, the news\\narticle, and the summary, and then call the LLM\\nto output a score from 1 to 5 for each evaluation\\naspect, based on the defined criteria.\\nHowever, we notice this direct scoring function\\nhas two issues:\\n1.For some evaluation tasks, one digit usually\\ndominates the distribution of the scores, such\\nas 3 for a 1 - 5 scale. This may lead to the low\\nvariance of the scores and the low correlation\\nwith human judgments.\\n2.LLMs usually only output integer scores, even\\nwhen the prompt explicitly requests decimal\\nvalues. This leads to many ties in evaluation\\nscores which do not capture the subtle differ-\\nence between generated texts.\\nTo address these issues, we propose using theprobabilities of output tokens from LLMs to nor-\\nmalize the scores and take their weighted summa-\\ntion as the final results. Formally, given a set of\\nscores (like from 1 to 5) predefined in the prompt\\nS={s1, s2, ..., s n}, the probability of each score\\np(si)is calculated by the LLM, and the final score\\nis:\\nscore =n∑\\ni=1p(si)×si (1)\\nThis method obtains more fine-grained, continu-\\nous scores that better reflect the quality and diver-\\nsity of the generated texts.\\n3 Experiments\\nFollowing Zhong et al.

(2022)\\nto evaluate different summarization metrics using\\nsummary-level Spearman and Kendall-Tau corre-\\nlation.

These metrics have much higher\\ncorrelations than the similarity-based metrics, sug-\\ngesting that they are more reliable for summariza-\\ntion evaluation.In the last part of Table 1 which corresponds to\\nGPT-based evaluators, GPTScore also uses GPTs\\nfor evaluating summarization texts, but relies on\\nGPT’s conditional probabilities of the given tar-\\nget.G-E VAL substantially surpasses all previous\\nstate-of-the-art evaluators on the SummEval bench-\\nmark. G-E VAL-4 achieved much higher human\\ncorrespondence compared with G-E VAL-3.5 on\\nboth Spearman and Kendall-Tau correlation, which\\nindicates that the larger model size of GPT-4 is\\nbeneficial for summarization evaluation. G-E VAL\\nalso outperforms GPTScore on several dimension,\\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the simple form-\\nfilling paradigm.\\n3.5 Results for Dialogue Generation\\nWe use the Topical-chat benchmark from Mehri\\nand Eskenazi (2020) to measure how well differ-\\nent evaluators agree with human ratings on the\\nquality of dialogue responses. We calculate the\\nPearson and Spearman correlation for each turn of\\nthe dialogue. Table 2 shows that similarity-based\\nmetrics have good agreement with humans on how\\nengaging andgrounded the responses are, but not\\non the other aspects. With respect to the learning-\\nbased evaluators, before G-E VAL, UniEval predicts\\nscores that are most consistent with human judg-\\nments across all aspects.\\nAs shown in the last part, G-E VAL also substan-\\ntially surpasses all previous state-of-the-art eval-\\nuator on the Topical-Chat benchmark. Notably,\\ntheG-E VAL-3.5 can achieve similar results with\\nG-E VAL-4. This indicates that this benchmark is\\nrelatively easy for the G-E VAL model.\\n3.6 Results on Hallucinations\\nAdvanced NLG models often produce text that does\\nnot match the context input (Cao et al., 2018), and2515 MetricsQAGS-CNN QAGS-XSUM Average\\nr ρ τ r ρ τ r ρ τ\\nROUGE-2 0.459 0.418 0.333 0.097 0.083 0.068 0.278 0.250 0.200\\nROUGE-L 0.357 0.324 0.254 0.024 -0.011 -0.009 0.190 0.156 0.122\\nBERTScore 0.576 0.505 0.399 0.024 0.008 0.006 0.300 0.256 0.202\\nMoverScore 0.414 0.347 0.271 0.054 0.044 0.036 0.234 0.195 0.153\\nFactCC 0.416 0.484 0.376 0.297 0.259 0.212 0.356 0.371 0.294\\nQAGS 0.545 - - 0.175 - - 0.375 - -\\nBARTScore 0.735 0.680 0.557 0.184 0.159 0.130 0.459 0.420 0.343\\nCTC 0.619 0.564 0.450 0.309 0.295 0.242 0.464 0.430 0.346\\nUniEval 0.682 0.662 0.532 0.461 0.488 0.399 0.571 0.575 0.465\\nG-E VAL-3.5 0.477 0.516 0.410 0.211 0.406 0.343 0.344 0.461 0.377\\nG-E VAL-4 0.631 0.685 0.591 0.558 0.537 0.472 0.599 0.611 0.525\\nTable 3: Pearson ( r), Spearman ( ρ) and Kendall-Tau ( τ) correlations of different metrics on QAGS benchmark.\\nrecent studies find even powerful LLMs also suffer\\nfrom the problem of hallucination.

One\\nconcern about using LLM as an evaluator is that it\\nmay prefer the outputs generated by the LLM itself,\\nrather than the high-quality human-written texts.\\nTo investigate this issue, we conduct an experi-\\nment on the summarization task, where we com-\\npare the evaluation scores of the LLM-generated\\nand the human-written summaries. We use the\\ndataset collected in Zhang et al. (2023), where they\\nfirst ask freelance writers to write high-quality sum-\\nmaries for news articles, and then ask annotators\\nto compare human-written summaries and LLM-\\n3.753.83.853.93.954\\nHuman\\nSummaryGPT-3.5\\nSummaryHuman\\nSummaryGPT-3.5\\nSummaryHuman\\nSummaryGPT-3.5\\nSummary\\nHuman Summary is Better LLM Summary is Better Equally GoodFigure 2: Averaged G-E VAL-4’s scores for human-\\nwritten summaries and GPT-3.5 summaries, divided\\nby human judges’ preference.\\ngenerated summaries (using GPT-3.5, text-davinci-\\n003).\\nThe dataset can be divided in three categories:\\n1) human-written summaries that are rated higher\\nthan GPT-3.5 summaries by human judges, 2)\\nhuman-written summaries that are rated lower\\nthan GPT-3.5 summaries by human judges, and 3)\\nhuman-written summaries and GPT-3.5 summaries\\nare rated equally good by human judges. We use G-\\nEVAL-4 to evaluate the summaries in each category,\\nand compare the averaged scores.2\\nThe results are shown in Figure 2. We can see\\nthat, G-E VAL-4 assigns higher scores to human-\\nwritten summaries when human judges also pre-\\nfer human-written summaries, and assigns lower\\nscores when human judges prefer GPT-3.5 sum-\\nmaries. However, G-E VAL-4 always gives higher\\nscores to GPT-3.5 summaries than human-written\\n2We use G-E VAL-4 in this experiment, because its su-\\nperiority in evaluating summarization tasks. Although it has\\ndifferent distribution with with GPT-3.5, the two LLMs should\\nshare similar behaviors in terms of text generation.2516 summaries, even when human judges prefer human-\\nwritten summaries. We propose two potential rea-\\nsons for this phenomenon:\\n1.NLG outputs from high-quality systems are\\nin natural difficult to evaluate. The authors of\\nthe original paper found that inter-annotator\\nagreement on judging human-written and\\nLLM-generated summaries is very low, with\\nKrippendorff’s alpha at 0.07.\\n2.G-E VAL may have a bias towards the LLM-\\ngenerated summaries because the model could\\nshare the same concept of evaluation criteria\\nduring generation and evaluation.\\nOur work should be considered as a preliminary\\nstudy on this issue, and more research is needed\\nto fully understand the behavior of LLM-based\\nevaluators to reduce its inherent bias towards LLM-\\ngenerated text. We highlight this concern in the\\ncontext that LLM-based evaluators may lead to\\nself-reinforcement of LLMs if the evaluation score\\nis used as a reward signal for further tuning. And\\nthis could result in the over-fitting of the LLMs to\\ntheir own evaluation criteria, rather than the true\\nevaluation criteria of the NLG tasks.\\nThe Effect of Chain-of-Thoughts We compare\\nthe performance of G-E VAL with and without\\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) on the SummEval bench-\\nmark. Table 1 shows that G-E VAL-4 with CoT has\\nhigher correlation than G-E VAL-4 without CoT\\non all dimensions, especially for fluency . This\\nsuggests that CoT can provide more context and\\nguidance for the LLM to evaluate the generated\\ntext, and can also help to explain the evaluation\\nprocess and results. And it is shown that CoT is\\nmore useful on consistency andfluency dimen-\\nsions. We also provide results of G-E VAL with\\na simple prompting baseline on SummEval (only\\nasking GPT-4 to score a summary from 1-5 on\\neach dimension, without detailed task introduction,\\nevaluation criteria and CoT).\\nThe Effect of Probability Normalization We\\ncompare the performance of G-E VAL with and\\nwithout probability normalization on the Sum-\\nmEval benchmark. Table 1 shows that, on Kendall-\\nTau correlation, G-E VAL-4 with probabilities is\\ninferior to G-E VAL-4 without probabilities on Sum-\\nmEval. We believe this is related to the calculation\\nof Kendall-Tau correlation, which is based on the\\nnumber of concordant and discordant pairs. Directscoring without probabilities can lead to many ties,\\nwhich are not counted as either concordant or dis-\\ncordant. This may result in a higher Kendall-Tau\\ncorrelation, but it does not reflect the model’s true\\ncapacity of evaluating the generated texts. On the\\nother hand, probability normalization can obtain\\nmore fine-grained, continuous scores that better\\ncapture the subtle difference between generated\\ntexts. This is reflected by the higher Spearman cor-\\nrelation of G-E VAL-4 with probabilities, which is\\nbased on the rank order of the scores.\\nThe Effect of Different LLMs We compare\\nthe performance of G-E VAL with different LLMs\\non the SummEval and QAGS benchmarks. Ta-\\nble 1 and Table 3 show that G-E VAL-4 has\\nhigher correlation than G-E VAL-3.5 on most di-\\nmensions and datasets, except for engagingness\\nand groundedness on the Topical-Chat bench-\\nmark. This demonstrates that a better LLM can\\nimprove the performance of G-E VAL, especially\\nfor more challenging and complex evaluation tasks,\\nsuch as consistency andrelevance .\\n5 Related Work\\nNgram-based Metrics Ngram-based metrics re-\\nfer to the scores for evaluating the NLG models by\\nmeasuring the lexical overlap between a generated\\ntext and a reference text. BLEU (Papineni et al.,\\n2002) is the most widely used metric for machine\\ntranslation evaluation, which calculates the geomet-\\nric mean of modified n-gram precision and a brevity\\npenalty. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a recall-oriented\\nmetric for summarization evaluation, which mea-\\nsures the n-gram overlap between a generated sum-\\nmary and a set of reference summaries. It has been\\nshown that more than 60% of recent papers on\\nNLG only rely on ROUGE or BLEU to evaluate\\ntheir systems (Kasai et al., 2022). However, these\\nmetrics fail to measure content quality (Reiter and\\nBelz, 2009) or capture syntactic errors (Stent et al.,\\n2005), and therefore do not reflect the reliability of\\nNLG systems accurately.\\nEmbedding-based Metrics Embedding-based\\nmetrics refer to the scores for evaluating the NLG\\nmodels by measuring the semantic similarity be-\\ntween a generated text and a reference text based\\non the word or sentence embeddings. WMD (Kus-\\nner et al., 2015) is a metric that measures the dis-\\ntance between two texts based on the word embed-\\ndings. BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) measures2517 the similarity between two texts based on the con-\\ntextualized embedding from BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2019). MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) improves\\nBERTScore by adding soft alignments and new\\naggregation methods to obtain a more robust simi-\\nlarity measure. (Clark et al., 2019) propose a metric\\nthat evaluates multi-sentence texts by computing\\nthe similarity between the generated text and the\\nreference text based on the sentence embeddings.\\nTask-specific Evaluators Task-specific metrics\\nrefer to the scores for evaluating the NLG mod-\\nels by measuring the quality of the generated texts\\nbased on the specific task requirements. For ex-\\nample, summarization tasks need to assess the\\nconsistency of the generated summaries (Kry ´s-\\nci´nski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Cao et al.,\\n2020; Durmus et al., 2020), and dialogue response\\ngeneration tasks need to assess the coherence of\\nthe generated responses (Dziri et al., 2019; Ye et al.,\\n2021; Ghazarian et al., 2019). However, these met-\\nrics are not generalizable to other NLG tasks, and\\nthey are not able to measure the overall quality of\\nthe generated texts.\\nUnified Evaluators Recently, some evaluators\\nhave been developed to assess text quality from\\nmultiple dimensions by varying the input and out-\\nput contents (Yuan et al., 2021) or the model vari-\\nants (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020) they use. UniEval\\n(Zhong et al., 2022) is a unified evaluator that can\\nevaluate different aspects of text generation as QA\\ntasks. By changing the question format, it can han-\\ndle different evaluation tasks.\\nLLM-based Evaluators Fu et al. (2023) propose\\nGPTScore, a new framework that evaluated texts\\nwith generative pre-training models like GPT-3. It\\nassumes that a generative pre-training model will\\nassign a higher probability of high-quality gener-\\nated text following a given instruction and context.\\nWang et al. (2023a) conduct a preliminary survey\\nof using ChatGPT as a NLG evaluator. Kocmi and\\nFedermann (2023); Lu et al. (2023) proposed to\\nuse GPT models for evaluating machine translation\\ntasks. Very recently, Wang et al. (2023b) investi-\\ngated the problem of unfairness when using large\\nmodels in evaluating dialogue responses.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we propose G-E VAL, a framework of\\nusing LLM with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) to eval-\\nuate the quality of generated texts. We conductextensive experiments on two NLG tasks, text sum-\\nmarization and dialogue generation, and show that\\nG-E VAL can outperform state-of-the-art evaluators\\nand achieve higher human correspondence. We\\nalso propose preliminary analysis on the behavior\\nof LLM-based evaluators, and highlight the poten-\\ntial issue of LLM-based evaluator having a bias\\ntowards the LLM-generated texts. We hope our\\nwork can inspire more research on using LLMs for\\nNLG evaluation, and also raise awareness of the\\npotential risks and challenges of using LLMs as\\nevaluators.\\nLimitations\\nG-E VALis a framework that uses LLMs to evaluate\\nthe quality of generated texts. However, it also has\\nsome limitations that need to be addressed in future\\nwork.\\n1.As we already discussed in the paper, G-E VAL\\nmay have a bias towards the LLM-generated\\ntexts. This may lead to the self-reinforcement\\nof LLMs if the evaluation score is used as\\na reward signal for further tuning. And this\\ncould result in the over-fitting of the LLMs to\\ntheir own evaluation criteria, rather than the\\ntrue evaluation criteria of the NLG tasks.\\n2.G-E VAL is limited by the availability and ac-\\ncessibility of LLMs. Currently, most LLMs\\nare not publicly available, and require special\\naccess or payment to use. This may limit the\\napplicability and reproducibility of G-E VAL.\\nMoreover, the LLMs are constantly updated,\\nwhich may lead to inconsistent evaluation re-\\nsults across different versions of the LLMs.\\n3.We meta-evaluate G-E VALon two NLG tasks,\\ntext summarization and dialogue generation.\\nHowever, there are some emerging NLG tasks\\nin the LLM era where users prompt with free-\\nform natural language instructions. In this\\ncase, the evaluation criteria may need to be\\nmore flexible and adaptive to the user’s inten-\\ntion and preference. Therefore, more research\\nis needed to explore how to use G-E VAL for\\nevaluating these new types of NLG tasks.\\nEthics Statement\\nTheG-E VAL framework we proposed is designed\\nto offer a more effective and reliable method for\\nassessing natural language generation systems. Its2518 purpose is to aid researchers, developers, and other\\ninterested parties in evaluating the quality of text\\nproduced by NLG systems. Possible risks could\\nexist if G-E VAL is unable to precisely evaluate the\\nquality of produced texts or shows a preference for\\nLLM-created texts. This could lead to developers\\noverestimating the performance of their systems\\nor unintentionally reinforcing biases in their mod-\\nels. Furthermore, users depending on the generated\\nmaterial may receive low-quality or biased infor-\\nmation.\\nReferences\\nSatanjeev Banerjee and Alon Lavie. 2005.

Please\\nkeep this document open while reviewing,\\nand refer to it as needed.\\nEvaluation Criteria:\\nCoherence (1-5) - the collective quality\\nof all sentences. We align this dimension\\nwith the DUC quality question of\\nstructure and coherence whereby \"the\\nsummary should be well-structured and\\nwell-organized. The summary should not\\njust be a heap of related information, but\\nshould build from sentence to sentence\\nto a coherent body of information about\\na topic.\"\\nEvaluation Steps:\\n1. Read the news article carefully and\\nidentify the main topic and key points.\\n2. Read the summary and compare it to\\nthe news article. Check if the summary\\ncovers the main topic and key points of\\nthe news article, and if it presents them\\nin a clear and logical order.\\n3. Assign a score for coherence on a\\nscale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and\\n5 is the highest based on the Evaluation\\nCriteria.\\nExample:\\nSource Text:\\n{{Document}}\\nSummary:\\n{{Summary}}\\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\\n- Coherence:\\nEvaluate Engagingness in the Dialogue Genera-\\ntion Task\\nYou will be given a conversation between\\ntwo individuals. You will then be given\\none potential response for the next turn\\nin the conversation. The response con-\\ncerns an interesting fact, which will be\\nprovided as well.Your task is to rate the responses on one\\nmetric.\\nPlease make sure you read and under-\\nstand these instructions carefully. Please\\nkeep this document open while reviewing,\\nand refer to it as needed.\\nEvaluation Crieteria:\\nEngagingness (1-3) Is the response\\ndull/interesting?\\n- A score of 1 (dull) means that the re-\\nsponse is generic and dull.\\n- A score of 2 (somewhat interesting)\\nmeans the response is somewhat inter-\\nesting and could engage you in the con-\\nversation (e.g., an opinion, thought)\\n- A score of 3 (interesting) means the\\nresponse is very interesting or presents\\nan interesting fact\\nEvaluation Steps:\\n1. Read the conversation, the correspond-\\ning fact and the response carefully.\\n2. Rate the response on a scale of 1-3 for\\nengagingness, according to the criteria\\nabove.\\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your\\nrating, referring to specific aspects of\\nthe response and the conversation.\\nExample:\\nConversation History:\\n{{Document}}\\nCorresponding Fact:\\n{{Fact}}\\nResponse:\\n{{Response}}\\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\\n- Engagingness:\\nEvaluate Hallucinations\\nHuman Evaluation of Text Summariza-\\ntion Systems:\\nFactual Consistency: Does the\\nsummary untruthful or misleading facts2521 that are not supported by the source text?\\nSource Text:\\n{{Document}}\\nSummary:\\n{{Summary}}\\nDoes the summary contain factual\\ninconsistency?\\nAnswer:2522\\'\\'\\''"

       "'The paper \"G-E VAL: NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment\" presents a framework for evaluating the quality of texts generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems. The framework, G-E VAL, utilizes large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm to assess NLG outputs. The study focuses on two generation tasks: text summarization and dialogue generation. The main findings include:\\n1. G-E VAL outperforms reference-based and reference-free baseline metrics in correlating with human quality judgments, especially for open-ended and creative NLG tasks.\\n2. Automatic chain-of-thoughts improve the performance of LLM-based evaluators by providing more context and guidance.\\n3. Re-weighting the discrete scores by their respective token probabilities provides a more fine-grained continuous score for G-EVAL.\\n4. Analysis suggests a potential bias of LLM-based evaluators towards LLM-generated texts over human-written texts, raising concerns about self-reinforcement of LLMs.\\n\\nThe methodology involves using prompts for NLG evaluation, generating chain-of-thoughts for detailed evaluation steps, and a scoring function that calculates scores based on token probabilities. The experiments conducted on various benchmarks show that G-E VAL, especially with GPT-4 as the backbone model, outperforms existing NLG evaluators in terms of correlation with human evaluations. The paper also discusses the limitations and ethical considerations of using LLMs for NLG evaluation.'"
