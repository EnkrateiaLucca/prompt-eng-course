      "Enhanced Answer: Leaves change color in autumn due to the breakdown of chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis. As the days become shorter and temperatures drop, trees prepare for dormancy by shedding their leaves. This reveals other pigments in the leaves, such as carotenoids (yellow and orange) and anthocyanins (red and purple), resulting in the vibrant colors we see in the fall. Environmental factors like temperature and sunlight trigger these chemical processes, and different tree species exhibit various colors based on the specific pigments present in their leaves. The timing and intensity of autumn leaf color can vary each year depending on weather conditions and tree health. The colorful display of autumn leaves attracts pollinators and seed-dispersing animals, aiding in reproduction and seed dispersal before winter. This phenomenon also draws tourists to areas known for their vibrant fall foliage, a practice known as \"leaf peeping.\"\n"
