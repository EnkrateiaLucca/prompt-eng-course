    "# Prompt Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is a piece of text that conveys to a LLM what the user wants. What the user wants can be many things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asking a question\n",
    "- Giving an instruction\n",
    "- Etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of a prompt are:\n",
    "1. Instruction: where you describe what you want\n",
    "2. Context: additional information to help with performance\n",
    "3. Input data: data the model has not seem to illustrate what you need\n",
    "4. Output indicator: How you prime the model to output what you want, for example asking the model [\"Let's think step by step\" and the end of a prompt can boost reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf). You can also write \"Output:\" to prime the model to just write the output and nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prompts can also be seen as a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM.](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2302.11382#:~:text=prompts%20are%20also%20a%20form%20of%20programming%20that%20can%20customize%20the%20outputs%20and%20interactions%20with%20an%20llm.)"
