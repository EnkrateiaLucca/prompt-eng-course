       "\"Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA have shown remarkable performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their vast knowledge. However, LLMs still struggle with limitations in understanding and retaining information. This study focuses on evaluating the self-knowledge of LLMs, which is their ability to recognize unanswerable or unknowable questions. An automated methodology is introduced to detect uncertainty in LLMs responses, along with a new dataset called SelfAware containing unanswerable questions. The study involves analyzing 20 LLMs, revealing a certain level of self-knowledge in these models. In-context learning and instruction tuning are shown to enhance the self-knowledge of LLMs. Despite these advancements, there is a notable gap between the self-knowledge of LLMs and human proficiency in recognizing their knowledge limits.\\n\\nThe study categorizes unanswerable questions into five groups, indicating varying levels of uncertainty. The assessment of self-knowledge is measured using the F1 score, highlighting the level of uncertainty in the responses of LLMs. Experimental results show that larger models tend to exhibit better self-knowledge, and instruction tuning can significantly improve their performance. However, even the most advanced LLMs fall short compared to human self-knowledge. This research emphasizes the importance of enhancing LLMs' ability to understand their own limitations, aiming for more accurate and reliable outcomes in NLP tasks.\""
